                    Palindrones date back at least to 79 AD, as a palindrome was found as a graffito at Herculaneum, a city buries by ash in that year. 
                    This has palindrome, called the Sator Square, consists of a sentence written in Latin: "Satro Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas" ("The Shower
                    Arepo holds with effort the wheels"). It is remarkable for the fact that the first letters of each word from the first word, the second
                    letters form the second word, and so forth. hence, it can be arranged into a word sqare that reads in four different ways: horizontally
                    or vertically from either top left to bottom right or bottom right to top left. As such, they can be referred to as palindromatic.

                    The palindromatic Latin riddle "In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni" ("we go in circle at night and are consumed by fire") describes
                    the behavior of moths. it is likely that this palindrome is from medieval rather than ancient times. The second word, borrowed from Greek
                    should properly be spelled gyrum.
